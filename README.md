Torpedo Game

Torpedo game consists of ships, torpedo (missile) and distinct stages of the game based on speed of
the ships. Three different variants of ship were specified as follows.

a. Destroyer – 1 LED, 12 Points
b. Battleship – 2 LEDs, 8 Points
c. Aircraft Carrier – 3 LEDs, 4 Points

A program was required to interface ATmega8535 (microcontroller) and STK 200 (Logic board)
with a switch light box, dual seven segment display, buzzer and on board switches. Ships were
required to be shown on switch light box and score on dual seven segment display. The behaviour
had to be defined in such a way that if a user presses the button corresponding to ship, program
should automatically increase the speed of the next ship and sound the buzzer while displaying the
total score. Finally, it was required to display ships in random order, random directions and random
times (Smith, 2016).
